# Disruptor Performance Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary

The multi-producer disruptor implementation is unable to match crossbeam channel performance due to several critical bottlenecks. This plan identifies the root causes and provides a systematic approach to achieve competitive throughput.

**Current Performance Gap**: Crossbeam channels significantly outperform the disruptor, particularly at higher batch sizes where channels achieve 15.4 Melem/s vs disruptor's 12.3 Melem/s (batch=100).

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough code analysis, I've identified the following critical performance bottlenecks:

### 1. **Available Buffer Implementation Inefficiency**
**Location**: `src/utils.rs:86-94` (`set_batch` method)
**Issue**: The current generation-based design in `AvailableSequenceBuffer` is actually well-optimized, but the implementation has room for micro-optimizations.

```rust
// Current implementation
pub fn set_batch(&self, start: i64, end: i64) {
    if start > end {
        return; // Handle invalid range
    }
    for seq in start..=end {
        self.set(seq);  // Individual calls to set()
    }
}
```

### 2. **Suboptimal Publish Path Scanning**
**Location**: `src/sequencer.rs:265-302` (`publish` method)
**Issue**: The publish method performs expensive scans even when cursor advancement is unlikely.

Key problems:
- Always calls `highest_published_sequence` even for out-of-order publishes
- SCAN_LIMIT of 4096 may be too aggressive for small batches
- CAS loop with spin_loop but no exponential backoff

### 3. **Atomic Ordering Overhead**
**Location**: `src/sequence.rs:89` (`compare_and_set`)
**Issue**: Uses `AcqRel/Acquire` which is correct but may be more expensive than necessary in some cases.

### 4. **Producer Capacity Wait Inefficiency**  
**Location**: `src/sequencer.rs:246-260` (`next` method)
**Issue**: Capacity waiting uses manual spin with `yield_now` instead of integrating with the waiting strategy.

```rust
// Current approach in next()
let mut spins: u32 = 0;
loop {
    let min_seq = Utils::get_minimum_sequence(&self.gating_sequences);
    // ... capacity check ...
    std::hint::spin_loop();
    spins = spins.wrapping_add(1);
    if spins & 0xFF == 0 {
        std::thread::yield_now();
    }
}
```

### 5. **Memory Access Patterns**
**Issue**: Cache line thrashing from concurrent access to shared sequences and buffer slots.

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Micro-optimize Available Buffer (Low Risk, Medium Impact)

**Optimize batch operations**:
```rust
// Proposed optimization in set_batch
pub fn set_batch(&self, start: i64, end: i64) {
    if start > end { return; }
    
    // Batch calculate generations to reduce division overhead
    let start_index = (start & self.index_mask) as usize;
    let end_index = (end & self.index_mask) as usize;
    let start_gen = start >> self.index_shift;
    
    if start_index <= end_index {
        // No wraparound case - can potentially vectorize
        for (i, seq) in (start..=end).enumerate() {
            let index = start_index + i;
            let generation = start_gen + ((seq - start) >> self.index_shift);
            unsafe {
                self.available_buffer.get_unchecked(index)
                    .value.store(generation, Ordering::Release);
            }
        }
    } else {
        // Wraparound case - fall back to individual calls
        for seq in start..=end {
            self.set(seq);
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: Optimize Publish Path (High Risk, High Impact)

**Smart scanning with adaptive limits**:
```rust
fn publish(&self, low: Sequence, high: Sequence) {
    // Mark published range as available
    self.available_buffer.set_batch(low, high);
    
    // Fast path: only advance if we're filling the gap
    let cursor_val = self.cursor.get();
    if low != cursor_val + 1 {
        return; // Out of order publish, let someone else advance
    }
    
    // Adaptive scan limit based on batch size
    let batch_size = high - low + 1;
    let scan_limit = if batch_size <= 10 { 
        256 
    } else if batch_size <= 100 { 
        1024 
    } else { 
        4096 
    };
    
    // Try to advance cursor with bounded retries
    const MAX_CAS_ATTEMPTS: u32 = 3;
    for attempt in 0..MAX_CAS_ATTEMPTS {
        let start = cursor_val + 1;
        let scan_to = std::cmp::min(high + scan_limit, start + scan_limit);
        let contiguous_end = self.available_buffer
            .highest_published_sequence(start, scan_to);
            
        if contiguous_end > cursor_val {
            if self.cursor.compare_and_set(cursor_val, contiguous_end) {
                self.waiting_strategy.signal_all_when_blocking();
                return;
            }
        }
        
        // Exponential backoff for contention
        for _ in 0..(1 << attempt) {
            std::hint::spin_loop();
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Reduce Atomic Ordering Cost (Low Risk, Low Impact)

Keep current `AcqRel/Acquire` ordering as it's correct and the performance gain would be minimal.

### Phase 4: Improve Producer Waiting (Medium Risk, Medium Impact)

**Integrate with waiting strategy**:
```rust
fn next(&self, n: Sequence) -> (Sequence, Sequence) {
    let next = self.high_water_mark.get_and_add(n);
    let end = next + n;
    let wrap_point = end - self.buffer_size;
    
    let cached = self.cached_value.get();
    if wrap_point > cached {
        // Use waiting strategy for consistent backoff behavior
        let min_sequences = vec![]; // Collect gating sequences
        if let Some(new_min) = self.waiting_strategy.wait_for(
            wrap_point, 
            &self.gating_sequences, 
            || false
        ) {
            self.cached_value.set(new_min);
        }
    }
    
    (next + 1, end)
}
```

### Phase 5: Memory Layout Optimizations (High Risk, High Impact)

**Separate hot/cold data**:
- Keep frequently accessed fields (cursor, high_water_mark) in separate cache lines
- Consider NUMA-aware allocation for large ring buffers
- Add prefetch hints for sequential access patterns

## Backup Plan

If optimizations don't achieve target performance:

1. **Alternative available buffer designs**:
   - Bit-packed availability flags
   - Lock-free MPMC queue for published sequences

2. **Fundamental architecture changes**:
   - Segment-based ring buffer to reduce contention
   - Per-producer sequence tracking

3. **Hybrid approaches**:
   - Use crossbeam channels internally for coordination
   - Maintain disruptor API for compatibility

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin Phase 1 implementation with adaptive scanning
2. **Week 1**: Complete micro-optimizations and establish new baseline  
3. **Week 2**: Implement core publish path improvements
4. **Week 3**: Advanced optimizations and final validation

The goal is to systematically eliminate performance bottlenecks while maintaining the disruptor's correctness guarantees and low-latency characteristics.
